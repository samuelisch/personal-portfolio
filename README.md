Personal Portfolio website

## Access Deployment and Motivation
My personal portfolio is accessbile by visiting [samuelisch.dev](https://samuelisch.dev), hosted on Github Pages.

I wanted to create a personal portfolio to give users an access to my latest, portfolio ready works, as well as reaching out to the wider community in hopes of attracting collaboration and professional opportunities.

### Features
This app is built with HTML, SASS, and TypeScript, bundled together with webpack. Though not a big project suiting TypeScript, I wanted to go head first in exploring typed JavaScript.

In the contact portion, I have implemented a form that validates users' e-mail with a backend server. This backend server then sends a confirmation email to the user, and another to myself, which contains the users' email input, for me to contact.
